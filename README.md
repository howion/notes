# Howion / Notes

This is where I will upload my various notes (or resources) related to different topics that I ended up using **Markown** + **KaTeX** instead of pen-paper.

For the notes I will publish here, I aim to use a formal tone, organized with a logical structure. I believe this is usually not the best approach when it comes to learning, so you may want to use these materials for revision purposes rather than as a learning material.

I have no idea how long and how often I will publish here. Most of my notes are on paper and are mostly sketches. I aspire to write my new (and maybe also old) notes in this format as I believe KaTeX and Markdown is much easier to work with and often enough.

## Table of Contents

### Notes / Compiled

Served via GitHub Pages on notes.howion.com, adjusted for printing or saving as PDF. You may also download the generated PDFs directly from `/docs` with `PDF` links provided below.

### Notes / Source

Some of those will be compiled via custom bash pipeline with the use of `pandoc`, `html-minifier-terser` and `chromium`. For now, there is no git hook or action to automate this as I plan to compile as I see fit and none of those notes are complete yet.

## Accessibility

For readability of source code, especially for the mathematical ones, you should consider switching to a custom markdown previewer with a light theme due to possibly transparent figures and KaTeX expressions. For now to edit notes, I personally use Visual Studio Code with:

* `Markdown Preview Github` by Matt Bierner to preview markdown files,
* `Markdown Emoji` by Matt Bierner to add Github emoji support to VSCode, make sure you also have an emoji font installed in your system, and
* `markdownlint` by David Anson to lint markdown files.

You must be able to easily see some cool **KaTeX** text below to read the source of these notes:

$$\KaTeX$$

## License

I’m still figuring out how to license this content. Some of it is distilled or adapted from commercial texts. For now, consider this (especially the notes) a personal archive, not an open-source resource.
