This is where I will upload my various notes (or resources) related to different topics that I ended up using **KaTeX** + **Markown** instead of pen-paper.

For the notes I will publish here, I aim to use a formal tone, organized with a logical structure. I believe this is usually not the best approach when it comes to learning, so you may want to use these materials for revision purposes rather than as a learning material.

I have no idea how long and how often I will publish here. Most of my notes are on paper and are mostly sketches. I aspire to write my new notes in this format as I believe **KaTeX** and **Markdown** is much easier to work with compareted to LaTeX and often enough. I may later convert my old notes to this format, but no promises.

## Accessibility

For best readability, you should consider switching to a light theme due to possibly transparent figures and KaTeX expressions. For now, I use Visual Studio Code with `Markdown Preview Github` by Matt Bierner to preview markdown files, and additionally  use `markdownlint` by David Anson.

You must be able to easily see some cool **KaTeX** text below to read these notes:

Iâ€™m still figuring out how to license this content. Much of it is distilled or adapted from commercial texts. For now, consider this a personal archive, not an open-source resource.
