This is where I will upload my various notes (or resources) related to different topics that I ended up using **KaTeX** + **Markown** instead of pen-paper.

For the notes I will publish here, I aim to use a formal tone, organized with a logical structure. I believe this is usually not the best approach when it comes to learning, so you may want to use these materials for revision purposes rather than as a learning material.

I have no idea how long and how often I will publish here. Most of my notes are on paper and are mostly sketches. I aspire to write my new (and maybe also old) notes in this format as I believe KaTeX and Markdown is much easier to work with and often enough.

## Accessibility

For best readability, especially for the mathematical ones, you should consider switching to a custom markdown previewer with a light theme due to possibly transparent figures and KaTeX expressions. For now, I personally use Visual Studio Code with:

* `Markdown Preview Github` by Matt Bierner to preview markdown files,
* `Markdown Emoji` by Matt Bierner to add Github emoji support to VSCode, and
* `markdownlint` by David Anson to lint markdown files.

You must be able to easily see some cool **KaTeX** text below to read some of these notes:

I’m still figuring out how to license this content. Some of it is distilled or adapted from commercial texts. For now, consider this (especially the notes) a personal archive, not an open-source resource.
