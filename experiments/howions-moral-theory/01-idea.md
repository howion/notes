# Howion's (Formal) Moral Theory

<!-- We will try to build an absolute formal mathematical model for moral reasoning. -->

I have noticed that there are certain patterns in moral discussions, this work is the result of those realizations as a way to formally understand those notions.

Firstly, in moral discussions, we give much higher meaning to sentient beings. For example, a judge or a baby has much more importance than any unsentient being such as a syringe, rock, or money. Only the sentient beings who are capable of action which we will call actors will play a fundamental role in our theory. What makes those unsentient objects of any value is the value assigned to them by actors.

Secondly, from a practical point of view, we try to deduce the best action given an situation. More we know about the situation, more refined judgment we arrive. There is always an option, for actors, to do nothing which is an action itself.

Thirdly, actions of actors transform the universe in an non-deterministic way. That is, we cannot absolutely tell beforehand which action will an actor take but we maybe try to conclude what is the most _optimal_ or _desired_ action is according to some metric.

At the moment this universe transformation model doesn't take into account the fact that universe has the time dimensions. That is, the timing of the actions taken are also as important as the actions themselves. Maybe a some kind of effect algebra should resolve this.

## Things to Resolve?

* Dependency
* Time
*

## Universe

An **universe**, denoted with $\mathcal{U}$ is (informally, the state of things)...

## Action

An **action** $\alpha$ is, informally, a transformation of some universe $\mathcal{U}_0$ to some other universe $\mathcal{U}_1$. Formally, an action $\alpha$ is the pair $(\mathcal{U}_0, \mathcal{U}_1)$.

The **do nothing** action will be denoted with $1$. This action, as the name imples, does nothing to the universe.

<!-- So actions forms an **monad** on universes. -->

## Actor

An **actor** $X$, is a sentient being in our theory that is capable of (reasoning AND) _action_. We will denote the set of an actor $X$'s possible actions by $\mathcal{A}(X)$.

## Context

A **context** is the total sum of our _knowledge_ about the _current state of things_. We will denote the context with the letter $\Gamma$. A **refinement** of a context is...

## Judgment

A **judgment**, usually denoted with $\mathcal{J}$, is the cannonical conclusion(s) we arrive by looking at the context under our theory.

## Axioms

<!-- 1. **(Context Equality)** Contexts are not relative. -->
