# Bookshelf

Updated at `10 July 2025`. I have indicated the properties of some resources with the indicators provided below.

* **:white_circle: : rather easy or introductory material for the related subject**
* **:o: : somewhat accesible to advanced undergraduate**
* **:red_circle: : graduate level**
* **:large_orange_diamond: : reference material**

It's a difficult matter to classify resources to their subjects and assign difficulty to them, especially for mathematical subjects, so consider this my best try.
