# Bookshelf

Updated at `10 July 2025`. I have indicated the properties of some resources with the indicators provided below.

* **:white_circle: : rather easy or introductory material for the related subject**
* **:o: : somewhat accesible to advanced undergraduate**
* **:red_circle: : graduate level**
* **:large_orange_diamond: : reference material**

It's a difficult matter to objectively classify resources to their subjects and assign difficulty to them, especially for mathematical subjects. So I have classified the resources as I see fit.

For example: I have seperated Graph Theory and Combinatorics and didn't place them under Discrete Mathematics. The situation is, from objective point of view, much worse for algebraic or interdisciplinary materials.

    * :white_circle: **Abstract Algebra** by I. N. Herstein.
        > Maybe not by itself but as an additional material this book is a must read. Might be rather difficult to follow compared to other Abstract Algebra textbooks but it is well worth it.

* ### Number Theory

    * :white_circle: **Introduction to Number Theory** by William W. Adams and Larry Joel Goldstein.
    * :white_circle: **Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem** by Ian Stewart and David Tall.

    * :white_circle: **Advanced Calculus** by R. Creighton Buck.
    > Nevermind the title it is just an another Calculus book but a bit harder. Note that this book leans towards analysis rather than applied calculus.

* ### Linear Algebra

    * Here be dragons.

* ### Analysis

    <!-- * :white_circle: **Principles of Mathematical Analysis** by Walter Rudin.
    > Didn't really even take a peek at this book but seemingly if you study Mathematics you must have this on your shelf. -->

    Analysis, however boring, is sometimes indispensable. I just skimmed these materials and took a look when I need to.

    * :white_circle: **Real Mathematical Analysis** by Charles C. Pugh.
    * :white_circle: **Understanding Analysis** by Stephan Abbott.
    * :white_circle: **Introduction to Probability** by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang.
    * :white_circle: **Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction** by Walter A. Strauss.
    * :o: **Spline Models for Observational Data** by Grace Wahba.
    * :o: `Article` **Some Results on Tchebycheffian Spline Functions\*** by George Kimeldorf and Grace Wahba.

* ### Combinatorics

    * :white_circle: **Concrete Mathematics** by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth and Oren Patashnik.

## Philosophy and Art

<!-- * **Pragmatism** by William James. -->
<!-- * **How the Mind Works**  by Steven Pinker. -->

* ### Historical

    * **Summa Theologica** by Thomas Aquinas.
    * **A History of Western Philosophy** by Bertrand Russel.
    * **Perspective as Symbolic Form** by Erwin Panofsky.
    * **Kant: A Very Short Introduction** by Roger Scruton.
    * `German` **Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen** + `English` **Thus Spoke Zarathustra** + `Turkish` **Böyle Buyurdu Zerdüşt** by Nietzsche.
    * **Beyond Good and Evil** by Nietzsche.
    * **Ecce Homo** by Nietzsche.
    * **Human, All Too Human** by Nietzsche.

    Well, I can hear your criticsm. I don't really read about History of Philosophy unless I need to. When I do, I use [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/). Most of these are from high-school or prep school and I didn't include mainstream books such as Plato as I wasn't really able to comprehend them. I remember that I liked Nietzsche tho and tried to read in 3 different languages.

    Anyway, only philosophical matter I rather feel comfortable with is Philosophy of Science. So here we go:
