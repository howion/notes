# Bookshelf

Updated at `10 July 2025`. I have indicated the properties of some resources with the indicators provided below.

<!-- * **:white_circle: : rather easy or introductory material for the related subject**
* **:o: : somewhat accesible to advanced undergraduate**
* **:red_circle: : graduate level**
* **:large_orange_diamond: : reference material** -->

It's a difficult matter to objectively classify works to a single subject, especially for the mathematical ones. So I have classified the resources as I personally see fit, there is no metric.

<!-- For example: I have seperated Graph Theory and Combinatorics and didn't place them under Discrete Mathematics. The situation is, from objective point of view, much worse for algebraic or interdisciplinary materials. -->
