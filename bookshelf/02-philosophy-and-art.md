    These are not necessarily books but they are dense and important for their respective field.

* ## Ethics

    * **The Elements of Moral Philosophy** by James Rachels and Stuart Rachels.
    * **This Is Ethics** by Jussi Suikkanen.

* ## Historical

    Well one could say all of Philosophy is History of Philosophy. These are the works I didn't want to create its own section nor didn't know how to classify.

    * **Summa Theologica** by Thomas Aquinas.
    * **A History of Western Philosophy** by Bertrand Russel.
    * **Perspective as Symbolic Form** (1924) by Erwin Panofsky. [**Scanned PDF**](https://monoskop.org/images/3/38/Panofsky_Erwin_Perspective_as_Symbolic_Form.pdf).
    * **Kant: A Very Short Introduction** by Roger Scruton.
    * **Beyond Good and Evil** by Nietzsche.
        > Actually, I find quite appealing most of Nietzsche's work; but, I don't really want to fill this section with Nietzsche.

    <!--
    * `German` **Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen** + `English` **Thus Spoke Zarathustra** + `Turkish` **Böyle Buyurdu Zerdüşt** by Nietzsche.
    * **Ecce Homo** by Nietzsche.
    * **Human, All Too Human** by Nietzsche. -->

    There is so much so to add here from many Wikipedia, Stanford Encyclopedia of Stanford to standalone articles, excerpts. These are the books that first come into my mind when I think of (general) history of philosophy.
