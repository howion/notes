    * **Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory** by Gaisi Takeuti, and Wilson M. Zaring.

* ## Logic

    * **Mathematical Logic**, 2nd Ed., by H.-D Ebbinghaus, J. Flum, and W. Thomas
    * **A Concise Introduction to Mathematical Logic**, 3rd Ed., by Wolfgang Rautenberg
        > This is as concise as the title suggests.

    * [**The Open Logic Text: Complete Build**](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/open-logic-complete.pdf) by various Open Source contributors.
    * **A First Course in Logic: An Introduction to Model Theory, Proof Theory, Computability and Complexity** by Shawn Hedman
    * **An Introduction to Proof Theory: Normalization, Cut-Elimination, and Consistency Proofs** by Paolo Mancosu, Sergio Galvan, and Richard Zach.
    * `Article` **How to Write 21<sup>st</sup> Century Proof** by Leslie Lamport.

* ## Abstract Algebra

    * **Fundamentals of the Theory of Groups**, translated second Russian Ed., by M.I. Kargapolov and Ju.I. Merzljakov
        > Good read for those already familiar with group theory, proceeds fast.

    * **Algebra** by Thomas W. Hungerford
        > Graduate text but rather easy to follow, especially you prefer rather formal and constructive way of teaching and comprehensive.

    * **Abstract Algebra**, 3rd Ed., by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote.
        > Classic

    * **Abstract Algebra** by I. N. Herstein.
        > Maybe not by itself but as an additional material this book is a must read. Might be rather difficult to follow compared to other Abstract Algebra textbooks but it is well worth it.

    * **Introduction to Rings and Modules**, 2nd Revised Ed., by C. Musili

* ## Number Theory

    * **Elementary Number Theory** by David M. Burton.
    * **Introduction to Number Theory** by William W. Adams and Larry Joel Goldstein.
    * **Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem** by Ian Stewart and David Tall.

* ## Graph Theory

    * **Fundamentals of Graph Theory** by Allan Bickle. An American Mathematical Society publication.

* ## Calculus

    * **Calculus: A Complete Course** by Robert A. Adams and Christopher Essex.
    * **Advanced Calculus** by R. Creighton Buck.
    > Nevermind the title it is just an another Calculus book but a bit harder. Note that this book leans towards analysis rather than applied calculus.

* ## Linear Algebra

    * Here be dragons.

* ## Analysis

    <!-- * **Principles of Mathematical Analysis** by Walter Rudin.
    > Didn't really even take a peek at this book but seemingly if you study Mathematics you must have this on your shelf. -->

    Analysis, however personally boring, is sometimes indispensable.

    * **Real Mathematical Analysis** by Charles C. Pugh.
    * **Understanding Analysis** by Stephan Abbott.
    * **Introduction to Probability** by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang.
        > My probability theory notes are, for now, mostly based on this book
    * **Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction** by Walter A. Strauss.
    * **Spline Models for Observational Data** by Grace Wahba.
    * `Article` **Some Results on Tchebycheffian Spline Functions\*** by George Kimeldorf and Grace Wahba.

* ## Combinatorics

    * **Concrete Mathematics** by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth and Oren Patashnik.

* ## Geometry

    > This is not really my topic of interest, but I park them here just in case I need a reference in the future.

    * **Geometry I** by Marcel Berger
    * **Geometry II** by Marcel Berger
