    * [**Math 320: Set Theory, Lecture Notes**](https://users.metu.edu.tr/burakk/lecturenotes/320lecturenotes.pdf) by [Burak Kaya](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/burakk/)
    * `Article` **How to Write 21<sup>st</sup> Century Proof** by Leslie Lamport.
    * **Introduction to Lattices and Order** by B.A. Davey and H.A. Priestley.
    * **Lattice Theory Lectures** by [John Harding](https://math.nmsu.edu/people/personal-pages/john-harding.html).

    * **Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory** by Gaisi Takeuti, and Wilson M. Zaring.
    * **An Introduction to Proof Theory: Normalization, Cut-Elimination, and Consistency Proofs** by Paolo Mancosu, Sergio Galvan, and Richard Zach.

* ## Abstract Algebra

    * **Abstract Algebra** by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote.
    * **Abstract Algebra** by I. N. Herstein.
        > Maybe not by itself but as an additional material this book is a must read. Might be rather difficult to follow compared to other Abstract Algebra textbooks but it is well worth it.

* ## Number Theory

    * **Elementary Number Theory** by David M. Burton.
    * **Introduction to Number Theory** by William W. Adams and Larry Joel Goldstein.
    * **Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem** by Ian Stewart and David Tall.

* ## Graph Theory

    * **Fundamentals of Graph Theory** by Allan Bickle. An American Mathematical Society publication.

* ## Calculus

    * **Calculus: A Complete Course** by Robert A. Adams and Christopher Essex.
    * **Advanced Calculus** by R. Creighton Buck.
    > Nevermind the title it is just an another Calculus book but a bit harder. Note that this book leans towards analysis rather than applied calculus.

* ## Linear Algebra

    * Here be dragons.

* ## Analysis

    <!-- * **Principles of Mathematical Analysis** by Walter Rudin.
    > Didn't really even take a peek at this book but seemingly if you study Mathematics you must have this on your shelf. -->

    Analysis, however boring, is sometimes indispensable. I just skimmed these materials and took a look when I need to.

    * **Real Mathematical Analysis** by Charles C. Pugh.
    * **Understanding Analysis** by Stephan Abbott.
    * **Introduction to Probability** by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang.
    * **Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction** by Walter A. Strauss.
    * **Spline Models for Observational Data** by Grace Wahba.
    * `Article` **Some Results on Tchebycheffian Spline Functions\*** by George Kimeldorf and Grace Wahba.

* ## Combinatorics

    * **Concrete Mathematics** by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth and Oren Patashnik.
