These subjects are closely related to mathematical logic, algebra and combinatorics so much so I hate to divide them but the line is sharp nowadays. So, make sure to also check out [**Mathematics Bookshelf**](./01-mathematics.md).

* ## Models of Computation

    * **Logic in Computer Science: Modelling and Reasoning about Systems** by Michael Huth and Mark Ryan
    * **Models of Computation** by John E. Savage
        > It is a reference book.

* ## Type Theory, Nets, and Linear Logic

    * **Types and Programming Languages** by Benjamin C. Pierce
        > This might be the **BEST** book on simple type theory and lambda calculus I have read as it teaches difficult matter with an invating and practical approach.
    * **Term Rewriting and All That** by Franz Baader and Tobias Nipkow
    * **The Lambda Calculus: Its Syntax and Semantics (Revised Edition)** by J. Barwise, D. Kaplan and others
    * **Proofs and Types** by Jean-Yves Girard, translated by Paul Tyler and Yves Lafont
    * **Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory** by Egbert Rĳke
    * Open Source [**Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics**](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) by various contributors.
    * `Article` **Towards Kleene Algebra with Recursion** by Hans Leiß
    * `Article` **Interaction Nets** by Yves Lafont
    * **Linear Logic** by Jean-Yves Girad
    * **Linear Logic: Its Syntax and Semantics** by Jean-Yves Girad
        > This is a good and short introduction to Linear Logic.
    * `Article` **The Linear Abstract Machine** by Yves Lafont.

* ## Cryptography
