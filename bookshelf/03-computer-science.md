These subjects are closely related to mathematical logic, algebra and combinatorics. So, make sure to also check out [**Mathematics Bookshelf**](./01-mathematics.md).

* ## Computation and Complexity

    * **Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach** by Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak.
    * **Introduction to the Theory of Computation** by Michael Sipser.
    * **Types and Programming Languages** by Benjamin C. Pierce.
        > This might be the **BEST** book on simple type theory and lambda calculus I have read as it teaches difficult matter with an invating and practical approach.
    * **The Lambda Calculus: Its Syntax and Semantics (Revised Edition)** by J. Barwise, D. Kaplan and others. This is a reference book.
        > Remember, this is a reference book.

* ## Cryptography

    Here be dragons, more on the way...

    * **Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C** by Bruce Schneier.

* ## Applied
