[Intro - Full Choir]
We are the builders of the coming world,
We are the ring and the field.
We are the reapers of abstraction,
We are the group and the action!

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant Echo]
Trauma... setta... nomen nulla...

[Verse 1]
Mert, the dreamer of the algebraic night,
Lost in the proof that never felt right.
He whispered, "Infinity is not enough,"
and vanished where the symbols roughened love.

[Background Chant]
Merta, merta, mentem fracta...

[Chorus - Full choir returns, loader]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant]
Academia... aeternitas...

[Verse 2]
Buğra still studies his French exam,
"Je ne sais quoi" becomes his damn!
Syntax breaks, the notes go stale,
He’s trapped in tense, he can’t exhale!

[Background Chant]
Bu-grá, Bu-grá, languam mortam!
Vive le chaos académique!

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant - Echo]
Cogito... ergo... despero...

[Verse 3]
Cem counts derivatives in his sleep,
Of thoughts, of dreams, of slopes too steep!
He takes the limit, finds no rest,
And differentiates his very chest!

[Chant - Echo]
Cemum derivat, semper derivat,
Delta vita, delta mortis!

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant rising]
Setta... trauma... ratio... dogma!

[Verse 4]
Yusuf, the keeper of paradox and pain,
He numbered the voids and broke the chain.
He said, "Truth is recursive, and so am I,"
then turned his notes into a silent sky.

[Background Chant]
Yusúf! Yusúf! Nullum daemon!
Void ex vita! Init init!

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Background chant overlapping with main choir]
Academia... aeternitas...
Nullum nomen... ratio fracta...

[Verse 5]
And the Emir!
FUCK YOU EMIR!

[Chant]
Emirum damnant! Emirum damnant!

[Final Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant]
Memoria... ratio... cadit...
Probatum est... finem est...

[Instrumental]
