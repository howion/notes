(We are) The Academia
=====================

[Intro - Full Choir]
We are the builders of the coming world,
We are the ring and the field.
We are the reapers of abstraction,
We are the group and the action!

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant]
Trauma... setta... nomen nulla... {Trauma... sets... no name...}

[Verse 1]
Mert, the dreamer of the algebraic night,
Lost in the proof that never felt right.
He whispered, "Infinity is not enough,"
and vanished where the symbols roughened love.

[Chant]
Merta, merta, mentem fracta... {Mert, Mert, the broken mind...}

[Chorus - Full choir returns, loader]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant]
Academia... (aeternitas) aeternitas... {Academia... eternity...}

[Verse 2]
Buğra still studies his French exam,
("Je ne sais quoi") becomes his damn!
Syntax breaks, the notes go stale,
(He's trapped in tense, he can't exhale!)

[Background Chant]
Bu-grá, Bu-grá, languam mortam! {Buğra, Buğra, the dead language!}
Vive le chaos académique! {Long live academic chaos!}

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

                [Chant]
                Cogito... ergo... despero...

[Verse 3]
Cem counts derivatives in his sleep,
Of thoughts, of dreams, of slopes too steep!
He takes the limit, finds no rest,
And differentiates his very chest!

[Chant]
Cemum derivat, semper derivat, {Cem differentiates, always differentiates,}
Delta vita, delta mortis! {Change in life, Change in death!}

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant - Rising]
(Academia) Setta... (aeternitas) trauma... (Academia) ratio... (aeternitas) {Sets... trauma... reason...}

[Verse 4]
Yusuf, the keeper of paradox and pain,
He numbered the voids and broke the chain.
He said, "Truth is recursive, and so am I,"
(then turned his notes into a silent sky.)

[Background Chant]
Yusúf! Yusúf! Nullum daemon! {Yusuf! Yusuf! No demon!}
Void ex vita! Init init! {(Cast the) Void from life! Initialize, initialize!}

[Chorus]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant]
Academia... (aeternitas) aeternitas... {Academia... eternity...}
(Nullum) Academia... (ratio) aeternitas... {Academia... eternity...}

[Verse 5]
And the Emir...
Fuck You Emir!

[Chant]
(Emira...) Emirum damnant! Emirum damnant! {They condemn Emir! They condemn Emir!}

[Final Chorus - Highest]
(We are) The Academia!
On the shoulders of giants!
No applications, no fame,
Just trauma and sets with no name!

[Chant]
Memoria... ratio... cadit... {Memory... reason... fails...}
Probatum est... finem est... {It is proven... it is the end...}

[Instrumental]
