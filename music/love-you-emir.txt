Love You Emir
=============

[Intro - Spoken]
So Emir, this is a song from your beloved friend Mert to his beloved friend you.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you and your stupid Sid Meier's Civilization.
Nobody gives a fuck whether every compact Hausdorff space is normal.

[Chorus]
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you and your stupid Sid Meier's Civilization.
Nobody gives a fuck whether every compact Hausdorff space is normal.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Your handwriting's a crime against first-order comprehension.
I tried to read your notes... existential dread!

[Chorus]
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you and your stupid Sid Meier's Civilization.
Nobody gives a fuck whether limits are unique in Hausdorff space.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Bro, what happened? You used to be one of us,
Now you're always out, never catching the bus.
You say you're busy, but we all know why,
You're hanging with girls, leaving the boys to die.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you Emir,
Fuck you and your stupid Sid Meier's Civilization.
Nobody gives a fuck about your new situation.

[Verse 4]
Fuck you Emir,
You lovable fool,
You left the boys hangin' - now that's just cruel.

[Outro â€“ Spoken]
So Emir, this was a song from your beloved friend Mert...
To remind you:
We still hate you... but in a loving way.

Fuck you Emir!

[Instrumental]
