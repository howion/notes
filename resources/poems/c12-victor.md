# Victor

> By Wystan Hugh Auden

Victor was a little baby,\
Into this world he came;\
His father took him on his knee and said:\
'Don't dishonour the family name.'

Victor looked up at his father\
Looked up with big round eyes:\
His father said; 'Victor, my only son,\
Don't you ever ever tell lies.'

Victor and his father went riding\
Out in a little dog-cart;\
His father took a Bible from his pocket and read;\
'Blessed are the pure in heart.'

It was a frosty December\
It wasn't the season for fruits;\
His father fell dead of heart disease\
While lacing up his boots.

It was a frosty December\
When into his grave he sank;\
His uncle found Victor a post as cashier\
In the Midland Countries Bank.

It was a frosty December\
Victor was only eighteen,\
But his figures were neat and his margins were straight\
And his cuffs were always clean.\
He took a room at the Peveril,\
A respectable boarding-house;\
And Time watched Victor day after day\
As a cat will watch a mouse.

The clerks slapped Victor on the shoulder;\
'Have you ever had woman?' they said,\
'Come down town with us on Saturday night.'\
Victor smiled and shook his head.

The manager sat in his office,\
Smoked a Corona cigar;\
Said: 'Victor's a decent fellow but\
He's too mousy to go far'.

Victor went up to his bedroom,\
Set the alarum bell;\
Climbed into bed, took his Bible and read\
Of what happened to Jezebel.

It was the First of April,\
Anna to the Peveril came;\
Her eyes, her lips, her breasts, her hips\
And her smile set men aflame.

She looked as pure as a schoolgirl\
On her First Communion day,\
Both her kisses were like the best champagne\
When she gave herself away.\
It was the Second of April,\
She was wearing a coat of fur;\
Victor met her upon the stairs\
And he fell in love with her.

The first time he made his proposal,\
She laughed, said 'I'll never wed';\
The second time there was a pause,\
Then she smiled and shook her head.

Anna looked into her mirror,\
Pouted and gave a frown;\
Said: 'Victor's as dull as a wet afternoon\
But I've got to settle down.'

The third time he made his proposal,\
As they walked by the Reservoir,\
She gave him a kiss like a blow on the head,\
Said: 'You are my heart's desire.'

They were married early in August,\
She said: 'Kiss me, you funny boy';\
Victor took her in his arms and said:\
'O my Helen of Troy.'

It was the middle of September,\
Victor came to the office one day;\
He was wearing a flower in his buttonhole,\
He was late but he was gay.\
The clerks were talking of Anna,\
The door was just ajar,\
One said: 'Poor old Victor, but where ignorance\
Is bliss, etcetera.'

Victor stood still as a statue,\
The door was just ajar;\
One said: 'God, what fun I had with her\
In that Baby Austin car.'

Victor walked out into the High Street.\
He walked to the edge of town;\
He came to the allotments and the rubbish heaps\
And his tears came tumbling down.

Victor looked up at the mountains,\
The mountains all covered with snow;\
Cried: 'Are you pleased with me, Father?'\
And the answer came back, 'No.'\

Victor came to the forest,\
Cried: 'Father, will she ever be true?'\
And the oaks and the beeches shook their heads\
And they answered: 'Not to you.'

Victor came to the meadow\
Where the wind went sweeping by;\
Cried: 'O, Father, I love her so',\
But the wind said: 'She must die.'

Victor came to the river\
Running so deep and so still;\
Crying: 'O Father, what shall I do?'\
And the river answered: 'Kill.'

Anna was sitting at table,\
Drawing cards from a pack;\
Anna was sitting at table\
Waiting for her husband to come back.

It wasn't the Jack of Diamonds\
Not the joker she drew first;\
It wasn't the King or Queen of Hearts\
But the Ace of Spades reversed.

Victor stood in the doorway,\
He didn't utter a word;\
She said: 'What's the matter, darling?'\
He behaved as if he hadn't heard.

There was a voice in his left ear,\
There was a voice in his right,\
There was a voice at the base of his skull\
Saying: 'She must die tonight.'

Victor picked up a carving-knife,\
His features were set and drawn,\
Said: 'Anna, it would have been better for you\
If you had not been born.'

Anna jumped up from the table,\
Anna started to scream,\
But Victor came slowly after her\
Like a horror in a dream.

She dodged behind the sofa,\
She tore down a curtain rod,\
But Victor followed her up the stairs\
And he caught her at the top.

He stood there above the body,\
He stood there holding the knife;\
And the blood ran down the stairs and sang:\
'I'm the Resurrection and the Life.'

They tapped Victor on the shoulder,\
They took him away in a van;\
He sat as quite as a lump of moss\
Saying: 'I am the Son of Man.'

Victor sat in a corner\
Making a woman of clay,\
Saying: 'I am Alpha and Omega, I shall come\
To judge the earth some day.'
