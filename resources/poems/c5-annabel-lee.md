# Annabel Lee

> By Edgar Allan Poe

<br/>

It was many and many a year ago,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In a kingdom by the sea,\
That a maiden there lived whom you may know\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;By the name of Annabel Lee;\
And this maiden she lived with no other thought\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Than to love and be loved by me.

<br/>

I was a child and she was a child,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In this kingdom by the sea,\
But we loved with a love that was more than love—\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I and my Annabel Lee—\
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Coveted her and me.

<br/>

And this was the reason that, long ago,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In this kingdom by the sea,\
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My beautiful Annabel Lee;\
So that her highborn kinsmen came\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And bore her away from me,\
To shut her up in a sepulchre\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In this kingdom by the sea.

<br/>

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Went envying her and me—\
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In this kingdom by the sea)\
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

<br/>

But our love it was stronger by far than the love\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of those who were older than we—\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of many far wiser than we—\
And neither the angels in Heaven above\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Nor the demons down under the sea\
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;

<br/>

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In her sepulchre there by the sea—\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In her tomb by the sounding sea.
