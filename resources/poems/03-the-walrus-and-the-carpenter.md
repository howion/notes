"The sun was shining on the sea,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Shining with all his might:\
He did his very best to make\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The billows smooth and bright —\
And this was odd, because it was\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The middle of the night.

<br/>

The moon was shining sulkily,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Because she thought the sun\
Had got no business to be there\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;After the day was done —\
"It's very rude of him," she said,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"To come and spoil the fun."

<br/>

The sea was wet as wet could be,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The sands were dry as dry.\
You could not see a cloud, because\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;No cloud was in the sky:\
No birds were flying overhead —\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There were no birds to fly.

<br/>

The Walrus and the Carpenter\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Were walking close at hand;\
They wept like anything to see\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Such quantities of sand:\
If this were only cleared away,'\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They said, it would be grand!'

<br/>

If seven maids with seven mops\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Swept it for half a year,\
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That they could get it clear?'\
I doubt it,' said the Carpenter,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And shed a bitter tear.

<br/>

O Oysters, come and walk with us!'\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The Walrus did beseech.\
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Along the briny beach:\
We cannot do with more than four,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To give a hand to each.'

<br/>

The eldest Oyster looked at him,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But never a word he said:\
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And shook his heavy head —\
Meaning to say he did not choose\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To leave the oyster-bed.

<br/>

But four young Oysters hurried up,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;All eager for the treat:\
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their shoes were clean and neat —\
And this was odd, because, you know,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They hadn't any feet.

<br/>

Four other Oysters followed them,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And yet another four;\
And thick and fast they came at last,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And more, and more, and more —\
All hopping through the frothy waves,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And scrambling to the shore.

<br/>

The Walrus and the Carpenter\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Walked on a mile or so,\
And then they rested on a rock\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Conveniently low:\
And all the little Oysters stood\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And waited in a row.

<br/>

The time has come,' the Walrus said,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To talk of many things:\
Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of cabbages — and kings —\
And why the sea is boiling hot —\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And whether pigs have wings.'

<br/>

But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Before we have our chat;\
For some of us are out of breath,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And all of us are fat!'\
No hurry!' said the Carpenter.\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They thanked him much for that.

<br/>

A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Is what we chiefly need:\
Pepper and vinegar besides\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Are very good indeed —\
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We can begin to feed.'

<br/>

But not on us!' the Oysters cried,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Turning a little blue.\
After such kindness, that would be\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A dismal thing to do!'\
The night is fine,' the Walrus said.\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Do you admire the view?

<br/>

It was so kind of you to come!\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And you are very nice!'\
The Carpenter said nothing but\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Cut us another slice:\
I wish you were not quite so deaf —\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I've had to ask you twice!'

<br/>

It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To play them such a trick,\
After we've brought them out so far,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And made them trot so quick!'\
The Carpenter said nothing but\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The butter's spread too thick!'

<br/>

I weep for you,' the Walrus said:\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I deeply sympathize.'\
With sobs and tears he sorted out\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Those of the largest size,\
Holding his pocket-handkerchief\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Before his streaming eyes.

<br/>

O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;You've had a pleasant run!\
Shall we be trotting home again?'\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But answer came there none —\
And this was scarcely odd, because\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They'd eaten every one."
