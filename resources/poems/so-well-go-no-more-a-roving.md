# So, we'll go no more a roving

> Lord Byron

So we'll go no more a roving\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So late into the night,\
Though the heart be still as loving,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul wears out the breast,\
And the heart must pause to breathe,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the day returns too soon,\
Yet we'll go no more a roving\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the light of the moon.
