## Substitution Ciphers

1. A **simple substitution cipher** or (**monoalphabetic cipher**) is one which each character of plaintext is replaced with a corresponding character of ciphertext.
2. A **homophonic substitution cipher**...
3. A **polygram substitution cipher**...
4. A **polyalphabetic substitution cipher**...

## Substitution Techniques

### (General) Caesar Cipher

$$C_i = \mathbf{E}_k(p_i) = (p_i + k) \mod 26$$

### Monoalphabetic Cipher

Given a permutation function $\sigma$ of order $|\sigma|=n$

$$C_i = \mathbf{E}_\sigma(p_i) = \sigma(p_i)$$

has a **keyspace** of size $n!$ (including the identity).

### Playfair Cipher

The best-known multiple-letter encryption cipher is the Playfair Cipher.

### Hill Cipher

Is an another multiple-letter cipher.
