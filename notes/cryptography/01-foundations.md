## Cryptanalytic Attacks

1. **Ciphertext-only** \
Given just ciphertexts for the same key, recover (future or given) plaintexts or infer key.

2. **Known-plaintext** \
Given ciphertexts for the same key and their plaintexts, deduce key or way to infer future plaintexts.

3. **Chosen-plaintext attack** \
Same as known-plaintext but the cryptanalyst gets to choose the plaintexts.

4. **Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack** \
Same as chosen-plaintext but the plaintexts are dependent on ciphertexts.

5. **Chosen-ciphertext attack** \
The cryptanalyst has access to decryption, so for choosen ciphertexts and their relative plaintext, deduces key.

6. **Choosen-key attack**

7. **Rubber-hose cryptanalysis** \
Socially infer key via means of bribery, blackmail, torture, etc. This is often the best way to break an algorithm.

## (Un)conditionally Secure

Only a **one-time pad** is **unconditionally secure**. That is, no matter how much ciphertext is given, there is not enough information to recover the plaintext.

All other cryptosystems are open to **brute-force** attacks. So, **computationally secure** ones are preferred which is open to interpretation. -->
