## Def. Cryptographic Protocol

A **cryptographic protocol** is a protocol that uses cryptography...It should not be possible to do more or learn more than what is specified in the protcol.

In an **arbitrated protocol**, a _disinterested_ (no vested interest) third party trusted to complete a protocol.

In an **adjudicated protocol** is subdivided into two sub-protocols: **non-arbitrated** and **arbitrated** called **adjudicator** when there is a dispute.

In a **self-enforcing protocol** the protocol itself guarantees fairness, therefore no arbitrator is required.
