* **The Open Logic Text**, [**Open Source**](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic), by various contributors
* **A First Course in Logic: An Introduction to Model Theory, Proof Theory, Computability and Complexity** by Shawn Hedman

> Compared to my other notes, my own taste is much more involved and preferred over textbooks given above.
