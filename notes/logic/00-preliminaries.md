# Logic

Basic (at least naive) set theory and simple combinatorics knowledge is assumed. Other than that, notes should be mostly self-sufficent.

Due to nature of these notes we will mostly work in second-order logic.

## Notation

* $0 \in \N$ and $\N^+ :=\ \N \setminus \{0\}$.
* $\varnothing$ denotes the empty set.
* Cardinality of a set $S$ is denoted with $|S|$.
