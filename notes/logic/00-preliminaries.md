# Logic

## Introduction

Superficial knowledge of computational complexity theory is assumed. You should be familiar with concepts such as PTIME, EXPSPACE etc.

Other than that, notes should be mostly self-sufficent for someone with the knowledge of at least basic set theory and simple combinatorics.

Due to nature of these notes we will mostly work in second-order logic.

> **TODO.** Add appendix for these prerequisites to superficially define them, or redirect to my or to online other resources.

## Resources

* [**The Open Logic Text**](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic), by various contributors
* **A First Course in Logic: An Introduction to Model Theory, Proof Theory, Computability and Complexity** by Shawn Hedman

## Notation

* $0 \in \N$ and $\N^+ :=\ \N \setminus \{0\}$.
* $\varnothing$ denotes the empty set.
* Cardinality of a set $S$ is denoted with $|S|$.
