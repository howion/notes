# 1. Categories

<!-- ## Introduction

We can think of category theory as a pure theory of functions, not a theory of functions derived from sets. -->

## Def. Category

A **category** $\mathcal{C}$ consists of

1. a collection (either a set or a proper class) of **objects** denoted with $\text{ob}(\mathcal{C})$,
2. a collection of **arrows** (or **homomorphisms**) called the **morphisms** of $\mathcal{C}$ denoted with $\text{mor}(\mathcal{C})$,
    1. A **domain** or **source** collection function $\text{dom}: \text{mor}(\mathcal{C}) \to \text{ob}(\mathcal{C})$,
    2. A **codomain** or **target** collection function $\text{cod}: \text{mor}(\mathcal{C}) \to \text{ob}(\mathcal{C})$,
    > Intuitively each arrow $f$ is a function (in an ordinary set-theoric sense) from an object $A \in \text{ob}(\mathcal{C})$ to an object $B \in \text{ob}(\mathcal{C})$.
