# Logic and Computation

## Introduction

Superficial knowledge of computational complexity theory is assumed. You should be familiar with concepts such as PTIME, EXPSPACE etc.

Other than that, notes should be mostly self-sufficient for someone with the knowledge of at least basic set theory and simple combinatorics.

Due to nature of these notes we will mostly work in second-order ordinary set-theoric logic.

> **TODO.** Add appendix for these prerequisites to superficially define them, or redirect to my or to online other resources.

## Notation

* $0 \in \N$ and $\N^+ :=\ \N \setminus \{0\}$.
* $\varnothing$ denotes the empty set.
* Cardinality of a set $S$ is denoted with $|S|$.

<!-- ## _Def._ Collection

Generally speaking, when it is said that $X$ is a **collection** it usually considered to be a set or a proper class.

In these notes, when we say **collection** or **set**, we will mean any set of any cardinality since we are working in an ordinary set-theoric foundation. If your underlying meta-theory is stronger, say NBG/GB, you may also allow a collection to be a proper class.

For this reason, when we say $S$ is a **subset** of a collection $X$, we actually mean $S$ is a **subclass** of $X$. -->
