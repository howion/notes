# Introduction

Economic problem arises because of **scarcity**.

Economic theory is divided into two parts:

* **Microeconomics** which is the study of individual choice, and how that choice is influenced by economic forces.
* **Macroeconomics** is the study of the economy as a whole.

## Marginals

**Marginal cost** is the additional cost over and above costs already incurred. **Marginal benefit** is the additional benefit above what has already derived.

So, if $\text{MB} \gt \text{MC}$, then it makes sense to do so.

**Opportunity cost** is the benefit that you might have gained from choosing the next-best alternative. In other words, it is the alternative forgone.

**Note:** For a decision to make sense (to be considered rational), opportunity cost should always be less than the benefit of what you have chosen.

Opportunity cost focuses on two aspects of the costs of a choice that may be forgotten:

* **Implicit costs** are costs associated with a decision that often are not included in normal accounting costs.
* **(Illusionary) sunk costs** are costs that show up in financial accounts that are already spent.

Implicit costs should be included in opportunity costs but sunk costs should not be included.  Note that costs relevant to decisions are often different from the measured (accounting) costs.

## The Invisible Hand Theorem

According to **the invisible hand theorem**, a market economy, through the price mechanism, will allocate resources **efficiently**.

* Price has a tendency to **fall** when quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded.
* Price has a tendency to **rise** when the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied.
