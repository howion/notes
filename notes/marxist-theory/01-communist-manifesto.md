# Communist Manifesto

> This is what a personal note looks like. Other contents are direct or paraphrased quotations from various works which are provided in the [**index**](./00-index.md).

With the note that this [**work**](https://www.marxists.org/admin/books/manifesto/Manifesto.pdf) written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels is a **manifesto** NOT an academic study:

* The _general principles_ laid down in the manifesto are, on the whole, as correct today as ever.
* From a practical point of view, on the other hand, should be subject to change as history provided.
* "The working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made State machinery, and wield it for its own purposes". (Marx & Engels; Tucker p. 470)

<!-- ### The Outline of the Manifesto

1. Class Struggle
2. Proleterian Measures
3. Criticisms of other types of Socialism
4. Communist tactics -->

## Class Struggle

### All History is the History of Class Struggles

> These terms do require some care. As a personal starter, simply, ask yourself "are you bourgeoisie?". If your answer is not a definitive yes, than you most probably are not.

> From a classical point of view, bourgeoisie is the class who has the control of means of production. From a modern point of view, the idea is essentially similar if not the same.

The manifesto is not _merely_ about:

* The **proletariat** vs the **bourgeoisie**

but rather:

* the **oppressed** vs the **oppressor**
* the **exploited** vs the **exploiter**

As always, there is a civil war within society where the involved parties are **classes**.

> To my suprise, I have seen some people deny the _idea of classes_. But it is not a political stand or even an idea. It is just a pure fact. There are classes. Just as in a classroom there are people who are man or woman, or short or tall, or rich or poor. Just as in Mathematics, a specfic class is a matter of definition and, as a result, those who it contains.
\
\
One may criticize the methodology of _using classes_. But without classes, I should argue, there would be no political theory. This is essentialy how we do science. We assign meaning to some _terms_ and discover the relations with each other.

From (Engels, English edition 1888) the terms bourgeoisie and proletariat are defined as:

* "By **bourgeoisie** is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage-labor."
* "By **proletariat** the class of modern wage-laborers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labor-power in order to live."

# Materialistic Conception of History

"Historical materialism begins with the simple proposition that human beings obtain the material conditions of their existence through specific and historically variable relationships with nature and with other human beings." (Ellen Wood)

## Base and Superstructure

See [**Wikipedia:** Base and Superstructure]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_and_superstructure) and [**Wikipedia:** Relations of Production]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_of_production).

In Marxist theory, societies consist of two parts: the **base** (or the **substructure**) and the **superstructure**.

Base refers to the **mode of production** (or the **economic superstructure**) which is a combination of the:

* **productive forces** that include **labour power** and **means of production** (raw materials, tools, land, infrastructure, animals, technical knowledge etc.)
* **relations of production** that directly relate to production. Total of social relationships that people must enter into in order to survive, to produce, and to reproduce their means of life.

Superstructure, on the other hand, refers to relationships and ideas that do not directly relate to production. Some examples would be:

* Law
* Science
* Religion
* Morality etc.

The relations of production determine the superstructure, and the superstructure supports the relations of production. But the relations of production themselves are dependent on the productive forces. The productive forces constantly evolve, and they eventually outgrow the old modes of production.

As proven historically, growth in productive forces is inevitable, and has its own inner dynamics.

When the extant relations of production can no longer control the productive forces, they are overthrown.

"...the means of production and of exchange , on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange,…the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters...they had to burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted to it, and by the economical and political sway of the bourgeois class" (p. 477-8)

## Marxist Stage Theory

"Marx held that human history had progressed through a series of stages, from ancient slave society through feudalism to capitalism. In each stage a dominant class uses its control of the means of production to exploit the labour of a larger class of workers. But internal tensions or “contradictions” in each stage eventually lead to the overthrow and replacement of the ruling class by its successor. Thus, the bourgeoisie overthrew the aristocracy and replaced feudalism with capitalism; so too, Marx predicted, will the proletariat overthrow the bourgeoisie and replace capitalism with communism.
\
\
Marx acknowledged that capitalism was a historically necessary stage of development that had brought about remarkable scientific and technological changes—changes that greatly increased aggregate wealth by extending humankind’s power over nature. The problem, Marx believed, was that this wealth—and the political power and economic opportunities that went with it—was unfairly distributed. The capitalists reap the profits while paying the workers a pittance for long hours of hard labour. Yet it is the workers who create economic value, according to Marx’s labour theory of value, which holds that the worth of a commodity is determined by the amount of labour required to produce it. Under capitalism, Marx claimed, workers are not paid fully or fairly for their labour because the capitalists siphon off surplus value, which they call profit. Thus, the bourgeois owners of the means of production amass enormous wealth, while the proletariat falls further into poverty. This wealth also enables the bourgeoisie to control the government or state, which does the bidding of the wealthy and the powerful to the detriment of the poor and the powerless."
