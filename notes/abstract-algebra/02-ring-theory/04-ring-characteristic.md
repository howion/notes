# Ring Characteristic

## Def. Characteristic

Let $R$ be any ring. The **characteristic** of $R$, denoted by $\text{Char}(R)$ is the least positive integer $n$ such that $na = 0$ for all $a \in R$. If such $n$ does not exists, then it is defined to be $0$.

## Thm. Basic Characteristic Properties

1. $\text{Char}(R) = 1$ if and only if $R = \Braket{0}$.
2. $\text{Char}(R) = 0$ if and only if the additive order $|1|$ is infinite.
3. $\text{Char}(R) = n \neq 0$ if and only if the additive order $|1|$ is equal to $n$.
