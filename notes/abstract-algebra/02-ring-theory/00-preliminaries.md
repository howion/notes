## Notation

* $0 \in \N$ and $\N^+ :=\ \N \setminus \{0\}$.
* $(m,n)$ denotes the **greatest common divisor** of $m$ and $n$.
* $\text{lcm}$ denotes the least common multiple function.
* $a\>|\>b$ denotes that the integer $a$ divides the integer $b$.
* $M_n(R)$ denotes $n \times n$ matrices over $R$.
* $R[X]$ denotes the set of finite polynomials with the constants in $R$ in the variable $X$.
* $R[X_1, ..., X_n]$ ... in several variables.

<!-- * $\text{Im }f$ denotes the **image** of a function $f: A \to B$, so does the $f(A)$. -->
<!-- * For a function $f: A \to B$, the **fiber of $f$ over $b \in B$** is defined as the **preimage** of $\{b\}$. That is, the elements of $A$ that maps to $b$. -->
