# Ring Examples

## Def. Ring of Continious Functions

Let $R$ be the set of real valued continious functions from the topological space $X$ to $\R$. For $f,g \in R$, define the pointwise operations for all $x \in X$ as

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
(f+g)(x) &= f(x) + g(x) \\
(fg)(x) &= f(x)g(x)
\end{array}
$$

Then $R$ is a commutative ring with unity where the additive identity is the constant map $\bold 0$ and the unity is the constant map $\bold 1$.
