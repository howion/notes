# 5. Generators

## Def. Generators

From now on, for a group $G$ and a subset $A \subseteq G$, we will denote by $L(G, A)$ the set of all subgroups of $G$ that contain $A$. In particular, $L(G)$ denotes the **set of all subgroups of $G$**.

Noting that intersection of any collection of subgroups are again a subgroup, we define for any set $M \subseteq G$, the **subgroup generated by $M$**, denoted $\Braket{M}$, as the intersection of all subgroups which contain $M$. That is

$$\Braket{M} := \bigcap_{H_i \> \in \> L(G, M)} H_i$$

Elements of $M$, or even $M$ itself, are called the **generators** of the subgroup $\Braket{M}$. If $M$ is finite, then we say $\Braket{M}$ is **finitely generated**.

An element is called a **non-generator** of a group $G$ if it can be omitted from every generating set for $G$.

Generally, this definition of a generated subgroup is not really easy to work with. So equivalently...

### Thm. Equivalent Generation Definition

If $M$ is a subset of a group $G$, then

$$
\Braket{M} = \Set{a_1^{\epsilon_1} \cdots a_k^{\epsilon_k} \> | \> a_i \in M, \epsilon_i = \pm 1, k = 1, 2, \dots }.
$$

### Thm. Equivalent Generation Definition 2

Let $G$ be a group and $M \subseteq G$, then

$$
\Braket{M} = \Set{a_1^{n_1} \cdots a_k^{n_k} \> | \> a_i \in M \text{ and } k,n_i \in \Z }.
$$

That is, $\Braket{M}$ consists of all finite products of $a_1^{n_1} \cdots a_k^{n_k}$.

> Therefore, in particular $\Braket{x} = \Set{x^n | n \in \Z}$. We will inspect these structures in detail in the next chapter.

## Def. Join of Subgroups

Let $H_i$ be subgroups of $G$, then their **join** is defined as $\Braket{\> \bigcup H_i \>}$ or, if finitely many, as $\Braket{H_1, ..., H_n}$. The join of two subgroups $H,K$ will simply be denoted as $H \lor K$.

<!-- TODO: -->

> This should make sense later on when we define lattices over groups. But the notation $H \lor K$ will sometimes be used to denote $\Braket{H \cup K}$.

## Examples

* $\Z = \Braket{1}$,
* $\Z_n = \Braket{\bar{1}}$,
* $\mathbb{Q} = \Braket{\dfrac{1}{n} \mid n = 1,2,\dots}$,

<!--  -->

* $\Z^* = \Braket{-1}$,
* $\mathbb{Q}^* = \Braket{-1, 2, 3, 5, 11, \dots}$,
