## Def. Generators

Noting that intersection of any collection of subgroups are again a subgroup, we define for any set $M$, the **subgroup generated by $M$**, denoted $\Braket{M}$, as the intersection of all subgroups which containt $M$. More explicitly,

$$\Braket{M} = \bigcap H_i$$

where $H_i$ is a subgroup of $G$ such that $M \subseteq H_i$.

Elements of $M$ are called the **generators** of the subgroup $\Braket{M}$. If $M$ is finite, then we say $\Braket{M}$ is **finitely generated**.

This definition, in practice, not really easy to work with, so equivalently...

## Thm.

If $M$ is a subset of a group $G$, then

$$
\Braket{M} = \Set{a_1^{\epsilon_1} \cdots a_n^{\epsilon_n} \> | \> a_i \in M, \epsilon_i = \pm 1, m = 1, 2, \dots }
$$

Similarly if $A$ is finite and $G$ is abelian, then

$$
\Braket{A}=\Braket{a_1, ..., a_n}=\Set{a_1^{z_1} a_2^{z_2} \cdots a_k^{z_k} | z_i \in \Z}
$$

If in this case, each $a_i$ has the finite order $d_i$

$$
|\Braket{A}| \leq d_1 d_2 \cdots d_k
$$

> This is somewhat similiar to (linear) span of $v_1, ... ,v_n$ for a vector space.

## Def. Join of Subgroups

Let $H_i$ be subgroups of $G$, then their **join** is defined as $\Braket{\> \bigcup H_i \>}$. The join of finitely many subgroups are also denoted as $\Braket{H_1, ..., H_n}$. The join of two subgroups $H,K$ sometimes denoted as $H \lor K$.

## Examples

* $\Z = \Braket{1}$,
* $\Z_n = \Braket{\bar{1}}$,
* $\mathbb{Q} = \Braket{\dfrac{1}{n} \mid n = 1,2,\dots}$,

<!--  -->

* $\Z^* = \Braket{-1}$,
* $\mathbb{Q}^* = \Braket{-1, 2, 3, 5, 11, \dots}$,
