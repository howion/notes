# Residuals

## Def. Residually Finite

We say a group $G$ is **residually finite** if for each $1 \neq g \in G$ there exists $N \trianglelefteq G$ of finite index such that $g \notin N$.

## _Thm._ Equivalent Residually Finite Conditions

A group $G$ is **residually finite** if and only if either

* for every $1_G \neq g \in G$ there is a group homomorphism $\varphi: G \to H$ where $H$ is a finite group and $\varphi(g) \neq 1_H$.
* the intersection of all its subgroups of finite index is trivial.
* the intersection of all its normal subgroups of finite index is trivial.
* $G$ can be embedded inside the direct product of a family of finite groups.
