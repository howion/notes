# 2. Group Examples

All of these groups can be considered their own field of research, so it is suggested you visit their wiki, understand the basics, and follow from there as you see fit.

## Klein $4$-Group

See [**Wikipedia: Klein  four-group**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_four-group).

The Klein $4$-group can be defined by the group presentation

$$
V = \Braket{a,b | a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e}.
$$

Such group is

* of order $4$,
* Abelian,
* all non-identity elements have order $2$,
* smallest non-cyclic group,
* isomorphic to Dihedral Group of order $4$,
* isomorphic to $\Z_2 \oplus \Z_2$.

> Also note that any group of order $4$ is isomorphic to either $\Z_4$ or $\Z_2 \oplus \Z_2$.

## Dihedral Groups

See [**Wikipedia: Dihedral group**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group).

## Symmetric Groups

See [**Wikipedia: Dihedral group**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group).

### Thm. Symmetric Groups Basics

* For $n > 2$ the symmetric group $S_n$ is nonabelian. So, $S_3$ is a good example of nonabelian group of order $3$.

## The Quaternion Group

See [**Wikipedia: Quaternion group**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion_group).

## The $\mathbb{Q}_p$ Group

For $p$ prime, define

$$
\mathbb{Q}_p := \left\{{m}/{p^n} : m,n \in \Z \right\}
$$

so that $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a (torsion-free) abelian group under the usual rational addition.

## Exercise 2

Prove that $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is _not_ isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}_r$ for distinct primes $p$ and $r$.
