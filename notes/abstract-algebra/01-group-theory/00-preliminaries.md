# 0. Preliminaries

* In these notes, all sets are considered to be proper sets as in ZFC, not classes.
* Basic (at least naive) set theory and simple combinatorics knowledge is assumed. Other than that, notes should be self-sufficent.

<!-- Knowledge of axiomatic set theory, category theory or lattice theory would be helpful. Indeed, if you are familiar with those subjects please send a pull request to `gh/howion/notes`. -->

> At the moment, these notes have a formal and reference-book like approach except these grayed out notes. I plan more intuition baked in for these notes, with much more visuals, examples and geometry involved.

## Resources Used

* **Algebra** by Thomas W. Hungerford
* **Fundamentals of the Theory of Groups**, translated second Russian Ed., by M.I. Kargapolov and Ju.I. Merzljakov
* [**Group Theory Exercises and Solutions**](https://users.metu.edu.tr/matmah/Graduate-Algebra-Solutions/grouptheory-1.pdf) by Mahmut Kuzucuoğlu
* [**Graduate Algebra Problems with Solutions**](https://users.metu.edu.tr/matmah/Graduate-Algebra-Solutions/graduate-algebra-solutions-10-11-2011.pdf) by Mahmut Kuzucuoğlu
* **Abstract Algebra**, 3rd Ed., by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote

## Notation

* $0 \in \N$ and $\N^+ :=\ \N \setminus \{0\}$.
* $(m,n)$ denotes the **greatest common divisor** of $m, n \in \N$.
* $\equiv_m$ denotes integer equivalence in modulo $m$.
* Cardinality of a set $S$ is denoted with $|S|$.
<!-- * $\text{Im }f$ denotes the **image** of a function $f: A \to B$, so does the $f(A)$. -->
<!-- * For a function $f: A \to B$, the **fiber of $f$ over $b \in B$** is defined as the **preimage** of $\{b\}$. That is, the elements of $A$ that maps to $b$. -->

## Currently

* There are not many exercises,
* Proofs are mostly absent,
* Typos are possible,
* Ordering is generally good but should be improved, and
* More visuals and intuition should be provided.
