# 0. Preliminaries

* In these notes, all sets are considered to be proper sets as in ZFC, not classes.
* Basic (at least naive) set theory knowledge is assumed. Other than that, not much knowledge is required. Knowledge of axiomatic set theory, category theory or lattice theory would be helpful. Indeed, if you are familiar with those subjects please send a pull request to `gh/howion/notes`.

> At the moment, these notes have a formal and reference-book-like approach except these grayed out notes. I plan to improve/write, either as a seperate extended version or for the next version, more intuition baked in for these notes, with much more visuals, examples and geometry involved.

## Resources Used

* **Algebra** by Thomas W. Hungerford
* **Fundamentals of the Theory of Groups**, translated second Russian Ed., by M.I. Kargapolov and Ju.I. Merzljakov
* **Abstract Algebra**, 3rd Ed., by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote

> **Hungerford** is preferred as a primary resource whereas **Kargapolov** is used for further topics in the theory and better notation and generalization in some concepts.

## Notation

* $0 \in \N$ and $\N^* :=\ \N \setminus \{0\}$.
* $(m,n)$ denotes the **greatest common divisor** of $m, n \in \N$.
* $\equiv_m$ denotes integer equivalence in modulo $m$.
* Cardinality of a set $S$ is denoted with $S$.
<!-- * $\text{Im }f$ denotes the **image** of a function $f: A \to B$, so does the $f(A)$. -->
<!-- * For a function $f: A \to B$, the **fiber of $f$ over $b \in B$** is defined as the **preimage** of $\{b\}$. That is, the elements of $A$ that maps to $b$. -->

## Currently

* There are not many exercises,
* Proofs are mostly absent,
* There are probably typos,
* Ordering is generally good but should be improved,
* More visuals and intuition should be provided for someone with knowledge of naive set theory.
