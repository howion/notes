# Projective Special Linear Groups

## _Def._ $\mathbf{PSL}_n(K)$

> By Jordan (1870)

Let $K$ be a field, then the quotient group of the special linear group $\mathbf{SL}_n(K)$ by it's center (the scalar matrices) is called the **projective special linear group of degree $n$ over $K$** denoted by $\mathbf{PSL}_2(K)$.

## _Thm._ Jordan-Dickson

Let $K$ be any field, then $\mathbf{PSL}_n(K)$ is simple with exceptions $\mathbf{PSL}_2(2)$ and $\mathbf{PSL}_2(3)$.

The linear fractional transformations

$$
f(x) = \dfrac{ax + b}{cx + d}
$$

with coefficients from the field $K$ and determinant $ad - bc = 1$ forms a group under composition. Moreover, this group is isomorphic to $\mathbf{PSL}_2(K)$.
