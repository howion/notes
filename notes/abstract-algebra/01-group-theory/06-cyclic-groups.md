# Cyclic Groups

## Def. Cyclic Group

A group $H$ is called **cyclic group**, or simply **cylic**, if $H$ can be generated by a single element. That is, there exists an element $x \in H$ such that $H = \Braket{x} = \Set{x^n | n \in \Z}$. Such $x$ is called the **generator** of $H$ or $H$ is **generated by $x$**.

Since cyclic groups are abelian (exercise), additive notation may also be used. In that case, $x^n$ becomes $nx$.

## Thm. Basic Cyclic Properties

Let $H$ be a cyclic, then

* $H$ is also abelian.
* If $x$ is a generator of $H$, then so is $x^{-1}$.
* If $x$ is a generator of $H$, then $|H| = |x|$.

## Thm. Element Order Divides its Identity Power

Let $G$ be a group, $g \in G$, and $m,n \in \Z$. If $x^m = 1$ and $x^n = 1$, then $x^d = 1$ where $d=(m,n)$.

This implies that for any $m$ such that $x^m = 1$, we have $|x| \mid m$.

## Thm. Same Order Cyclics are Isomorphic

For any two cyclic groups $\Braket{x}$ and $\Braket{y}$, if their orders are the same, there exists an isomorphism $\varphi : \Braket{x} \to \Braket{y}$.

1. Indeed, if they are finite, then the map

    $$
    \begin{array}{cc}
        \varphi: & \Braket{x} \to \Braket{y} \\ \\
        & x^k \mapsto y^k
    \end{array}
    $$

    is well-defined and an isomorphism.

2. If they are infinite, then the map

    $$
    \begin{array}{cc}
        \varphi: & \Z \to \Braket{x} \\ \\
        & k \mapsto x^k
    \end{array}
    $$

    is well-defined and an isomorphism. Therefore, any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to $\Z$.

## Thm. More Group Properties

Let $G$ be a group (not necessarily cyclic), $x \in G$ and $a \in \Z \setminus \{0\}$, then

1. If $|x| = \infty$, then $|x^a|=\infty$.
2. If $|x| = n$, then $|x^a| = \dfrac{n}{(n, a)}$.

> This is a very useful result.

## Thm. on Generators of Cyclics

Let $H = \Braket{x}$, then

1. If $H$ is infinite, then $H = \Braket{x^a}$ if and only if $a = \pm 1$.
2. If $H$ is finite, then $|H|=|x|=n$ and $H = \Braket{x^a}$ if and only if $(a,n)=1$. Therefore, the number of generators of $H$ equals to $\varphi(n)$ where $\varphi$ is Euler's $\phi$-function.

## Thm. Cyclic Properties

Let $H=\Braket{x}$ be cyclic, then

1. Every subgroup of $H$ is also cyclic.
2. If $H$ is infinite, then for any distinct non-negative integers $a$ and $b$, $\Braket{x^a} \neq \Braket{x^b}$.
3. For every integer $m$ we have $\Braket{x^m} = \Braket{x^{-m}}$. Therefore, evey non-trivial subgroup of $H$...
