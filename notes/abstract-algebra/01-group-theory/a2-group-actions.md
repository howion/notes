Let $G$ be a group and $X$ any set. A binary operation $\bullet: G \times X \to X$ is called a **(left) group action** if, for all $a,b \in G$ and $x \in X$:

* $a \bullet (b \bullet x) = (a b) \bullet x$, and
* $e \bullet x = x$

> For establishing general properties of group actions, it suffices to consider only left actions. (TODO: Why)
