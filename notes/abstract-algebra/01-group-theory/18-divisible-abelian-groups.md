# Divisible Abelian Groups

## _Def._ Divisible Group

A group $G$ is said to be **divisible (or radicable)** if for every $n \in \Z^+$ and every element $g \in G$ the equation

$$
nx = g
$$

has at least one solution in $G$.

## _Thm._ Divisible Embedding of Abelian Groups

Every abelian group can be embedded in some divisible abelian group.

## _Thm._ Divisible Subgroups

A divisible subgroup $D$ of an abelian group $G$ is a direct summand of $G$, that is $G = D \oplus B$ for some subgroup $B$ of $G$.

> Existence of such $B$ follows from Zorn's Lemma.

## _Thm._ Divisible Group Decomposition

Every divisible group $G$ can be decomposed as a direct sum of subgroups each isomorphic to either $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$ or the quasicyclic (Prüfer) group $\mathbf{C}_{p^\infty}$ where $p$ may vary for different summands.

## Exercises

### #1 and #2

In a torsion-free abelian group, the intersection of an arbitrary set of divisible subgroups is also divisible.

Show, by example, that this is not necessarily the case for periodic groups.
