# Periodic Abelian Groups

## _Def._ Torsion Subgroup

Let $G$ be an abelian group and $T$ the set of _all_ elements of finite order, then $T$ is a subgroup of $G$ called the **torsion subgroup** of $G$. Moreover, $G/T$ is also torsion-free.

> Note that, in general, the torsion subgroup is not a direct factor.

## _Thm._ Prüfer's First Theorem

> First check out **Exercise 1** below.

An abelian $p$-group of finite exponent is a direct sum of cyclic subgroups.

## _Def._ Pure Subgroup

A subgroup $A$ of a group $G$ is said to be **pure** if for every $n \in \Z$ and $a \in A$, the equation

$$
nx = a
$$

is soluble in $G$ implies it is soluble in $A$.

## _Thm._ L.Ja.Kulikov-Prüfer

> You may want to solve exercises first.

If $A$ is a pure subgroup of finite exponent of an abelian group $G$, then $A$ is a direct summand of $G$.

> By exercise 3

In particular, the torsion subgroup $T$ of abelian group $G$ is a direct summand of $G$.

## _Def._ Height

An non-identity element $g$ of an abelian $p$-group $G$ has finite height $h$ in $G$ if the equation

$$
p^n x = g
$$

has a solution only for $n \leq h$. Moreover, the height of $g$ is defined to infinite if it has a solution for every $n$.

## _Thm._ Prüfer's Second Theorem

A countable abelian $p$-group without elements of infinite height is a direct sum of cyclic subgroups.

## Exercises

### #1

An abelian group of prime exponent $p$ is a direct sum of cyclic subgroups.

### #2

In a direct sum of abelian groups, each summand is pure.

### #3

The torsion subgroup $T$ of an abelian group $G$ is pure in $G$.

### #4

A subgroup $A$ of an abelian $p$-group $G$ pure if and only if whenever an equation of the form

$$
p^n x = a \in A
$$

has a solution $G$ implies it has a solution in $A$.
