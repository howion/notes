# Normal and Subnormal Series

## _Def._ Normal Series

Let $G$ be a group. A **subnormal series** (or just **series**) is a sequence of subgroups such that each $N_{i+1}$ is normal in $N_{i}$, that is

$$
G = N_0 \trianglerighteq N_1 \trianglerighteq \cdots \trianglerighteq N_n
$$

The **factors** (or **factor groups**) of the series are the quotient groups $N_{i+1}/N_{i}$. The **length** of the series is the number of strict inclusions (or equivalently, the number of non-identity factors).

> Generally, $n$ could be any ordinal.

## _Def._ Composition and Solvable Series

A subnormal series $(G)_i$ is called **composition series** if each factor $G_i/G_{i+1}$ is simple.

Moreover, $(G)_i$ is called **solvable series** if each factor is abelian.

## _Thm._ Solvability

A group $G$ is solvable if and only if it has a solvable series.

## _Thm._ Jordan-Hölder

Any two composition series of a group $G$ are equivalent.

> Note that this theorem does not assert the existence of composition series.

<!-- TODO: Nonabelian simple groups of small order are quite rare. It can be proved that there are (up to isomorphism) only two nonabelian simple groups of order less than 200, namely As and a subgroup of S7 of order 168. -->
