# Normal and Subnormal Series

<!-- ## _Def._ Subnormal Series

A **subnormal series** of a group $G$ is a chain of subgroups

$$
G := G_0 \trianglerighteq G_1 \trianglerighteq \cdots \trianglerighteq G_n
$$

The **factors** of the series are the quotient groups $G_i/G_{i+1}$, and the **length** of the series is the number of strict inclusions (or equivalently number of non-identity factors).

A subnormal series such that $G_i \trianglelefteq G$ for all $i$ is said to be **normal**.

## _Def._ Normal Series

Let $G$ be a group. A **subnormal series** (or **normal series** or just **series**) is a sequence of subgroups such that each is normal in the successive term, that is

$$
N_0 \trianglelefteq N_1 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq N_n
$$

The **factors** (or **factor groups**) of the series are the quotient groups $N_{i+1}/N_{i}$.

> Generally, $n$ could be any ordinal. There are many ways to define normal series we gave a rather general definition here but it is generally assumed that $N_0 := \Braket{e}$.
