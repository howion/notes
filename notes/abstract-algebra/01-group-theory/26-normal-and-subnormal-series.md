## _Def._ Subnormal Series

A **subnormal series** of a group $G$ is a chain of subgroups

$$
G := G_0 \trianglerighteq G_1 \trianglerighteq \cdots \trianglerighteq G_n
$$

The **factors** of the series are the quotient groups $G_i/G_{i+1}$, and the **length** of the series is the number of strict inclusions (or equivalently number of non-identity factors).

A subnormal series such that $G_i \trianglelefteq G$ for all $i$ is said to be **normal**.

> Subnormal series need not to be normal.
