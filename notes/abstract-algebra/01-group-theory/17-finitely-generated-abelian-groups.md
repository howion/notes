# 17. Finitely Generated Abelian Groups

## Thm. Cyclic Decomposition

Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group, then

$$
G \cong C_1 \oplus C_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus C_n
$$

where each $C_i$ is a cyclic group with finite ones of order $m_i > 1$ to $m_k$ such that

$$
m_1 \mid m_2 \mid \cdots \mid m_k
$$

## Thm. Cyclic Decomposition 2

Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group, then

$$
G \cong C_1 \oplus C_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus C_n
$$

where each $C_i$ is either infinite or of order a power of a prime.

> Notice that this theorem implies if positive integer $m$ divides the order of a group, then there exists a subgroup of order $m$. This is not the case for any group, we have just proved this for finite abelian groups. We'll touch this subject later on Sylow Theorems.

## Thm. Prime Decomposition and Cyclics

Let $m = p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_k^{n_k}$ be a positive integer such that each $p_i$ is a distinct prime and $n_i > 0$, then

$$
\Z_m \cong \Z_{p_1^{n_1}} \oplus \Z_{p_2^{n_2}} \oplus \cdots \oplus \Z_{p_k^{n_k}}
$$

## Corollary. FGA Subgroups

Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group of order $n$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $m$ for every positive integer $m$ that divies $n$.
