## Def. Maximal Subgroup

Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a proper subgroups of $G$. We say $H$ is a **maximal subgroup** if $H \subseteq K$ implies $K = H$ for all $K \lt G$.

> Simply, $H$ is maximal if there is no greater proper subgroup which contain it.

## Def. Frattini Subgroup

Let $G$ be a group. We define **frattini subgroup** $\Phi(G)$ as the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $G$. In the case $G$ has no maximal subgroups, we define $\Phi(G) = G$.

> This is analogous to the Jacobson radical in the ring theory.

## Thm. Frattini Subgroup and Non-Generators

The frattini subgroup $\Phi(G)$ of a group $G$ is equal to the set of all non-generators of $G$. Therefore, non-generators of a group form a subgroup &mdash; namely the frattini subgroup.

<!-- If $G$ is finite, then $\Phi(G)$ is nilpotent -->

## Def. Simple Group

A group is said to be **simple** if it has no proper normal subgroups.

## Thm. On Simple Groups

1. $\Z_p$ is simple if $p$ is prime. Does the converse holds?
