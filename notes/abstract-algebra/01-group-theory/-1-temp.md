## Some Important Groups

## Def. Subgroup

Let $(G, *)$ be a group and $H \subseteq G$. The (necessarily nonempty) subset $H$ is called a **subgroup** if $H$ is a group under the same binary operation $*$ (and thus also the same identity) denoted by $H \leq G$.

Alternatively, the non-empty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if:

* For all $a,b \in H$ we have $ab^{-1} \in H$

## Def. Centralizer

Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group and $A$ nonempty subset of $G$. The subset

$$C_G(A) = \{ g \in G \> | \> gag^{-1} = a \enspace \text{for all} \enspace a \in A \}$$

is a subgroup of $G$ (exercise) and is called the **centralizer of $A$ (in $G$)**.

If $A=\{a\}$, then for simplicity we will use the notation $C_G(a)$.
