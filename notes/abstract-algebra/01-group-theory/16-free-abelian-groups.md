# 16. Free Abelian Groups

> In this section we will use additive notation rather than our usual multiplicative notation.

## Def. Basis

Noting that the subgroup $\Braket{X}$ generated by $X$ in additive notation consists of all **linear combinations**

$$
n_1x_1 + n_2x_2+ \cdots + n_kx_k
$$

where $n_i \in \Z$ and $x_i \in X$.

A **basis** of an abelian group $F$ is a subset $X$ of $F$ such that

* $F = \Braket{X}$, and
* for distinct $x_1, ..., x_n \in X$ and $n_i \in \Z$ we have $$n_1x_1 + \cdots + n_kx_k = 0 \implies n_i = 0 \quad \forall i$$

## Thm. Equivalent Basis Conditions

Let $F$ be an abelian group, then the following are equivalent

1. $F$ has a non-empty basis,
2. $F$ is the (internal) direct sum of a family of infinite cyclic subgroups,
3. $F$ is (isomorphic to) a direct sum of copies of $(\Z, +)$,
<!-- 4. $F$ is a free object in the category of abelian groups. -->

## Def. Free Abelian Group

Let $F$ be an abelian group, then it is called a **free abelian group** if it has a non-empty basis.

## Thm. Basis Cardinality

Any two bases of a free abelian group $F$ have the same cardinality called the **rank** of $F$.

## Thm. Isomorphism on Free Abelian Groups

Two free abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank.

## Thm. Free Abelian Groups and Abelian Groups

Every abelian group $G$ is the homomorphic image of a free abelian group of rank $|X|$ where $X$ is a set of generators of $G$.

## Thm. Basis for Subgroups

Let $F$ be a free abelian group of finite rank $n$ with the basis $\Set{x_1, ..., x_n}$ and $G$ its non-zero subgroup, then there exists an integer $r \leq n$ and positive integers $d_1,...,d_r$ such that $d_1\>|\>d_2\>|\>\cdots\>|\>d_r$ where $G$ is free abelian with the basis $\Set{d_1x_1, ..., d_rx_r}$.

### Corollary. Rank of Subgroups

Let $G$ be an finitely generated abelian group generated by $n$ elements, then every subgroup $H$ of $G$ is generated by $m$ elements where $m \leq n$.
