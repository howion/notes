# Preliminaries

Please, first check out the notations, provided in the [**Index**](./00-index.md).

## Def. Simple Operations on Sets

Let $A,B \subseteq S$ and $s \in S$, then we define the multiplication on these sets as

$$
s \cdot A = \Set{s \cdot a \in S | a \in A } \\
A \cdot B = \Set{a \cdot b \in S | a \in A,\> b \in B} \\
$$

where "$\cdot$" is a binary operation defined on $S$ that is known from the context. Notice that in additive notation, instead of simply $AB$, we would have $A + B$.

> Notice that if "$\cdot$" commutes, then $AB=BA$.

## Glossary

You should also be familiar with those definitions and their respective notations. If not, you should consider studying some set theory first.
