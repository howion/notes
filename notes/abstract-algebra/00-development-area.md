# Development Area

## Active

- Karg
- Rings
- Characteristic and relation to frattini subgroup
- idempotent, nilpotent, $p$-group etc. See [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frattini_subgroup)
- Sylows of course
- Cauchy's Thm Proof

## To-Do's

### General

- Add examples from my notebook.
- Add much, much more exercises for both groups and rings.
- Least positive integer definition from Algebra I and the theorem used in.
- Inline Todo's.
- **Add proofs and solution of non-trivial exercises separately.**
- Maybe also add/refer other fundamental results such as Zorn's Lemma!, Division Algorithm, Well-Ordering Principle, AoC. Remember the lattice theory notes of mine.
- Fitting subgroup

### Rings

- Rings of continuous functions
- Matrix rings
- Polynomial rings (and in several variables)
- ~~Power series rings (and in several variables)~~
- ~~Laurent rings~~
- Boolean rings
- Direct products on rings
- Opposite rings
- **Much more exercises are required for rings compared to groups.**
- Jacobson radical

---

- Ring ideals (maximal, minimal, prime)
- Generators for subrings and ideals

## Additional Resources

> I plan to add further results from these resources, but not at the moment.

- [The number of homomorphisms from $Z_n$ to $Z_m$](https://users.metu.edu.tr/sozkap/461/The%20number%20of%20homomorphisms%20from%20Zn%20to%20Zm.pdf).
- [Classification of Finite Rings](https://users.metu.edu.tr/sozkap/461/Classification_of_Finite-Finite%20rings.pdf)
- [A nice set of lecture notes by Mike Prest which covers more topics (especially chapters 0,1,2,6. May omit 3,4,5 at first)](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/mike.prest/NCAlgCrseNotes2019.pdf)

## Finally

- Draw (more) diagrams.
- Proofread all.
- Re-order all.
- (Re-)enumerate Thms, Defs, Exercises etc.
