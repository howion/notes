## Active

- Rings
- Frattini subgroup [Wiki: Frattini subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frattini_subgroup)
- Cauchy's Thm (relocate)

## To-Do's

### General

- Add examples from my notebook.
- Add much, much more exercises for both groups and rings.
- Least positive integer definition from Algebra I and the theorem used in.
- Inline Todo's.
- **Add proofs and solution of non-trivial exercises separately.**
- Maybe also add/refer other fundamental results such as Zorn's Lemma!, Division Algorithm, Well-Ordering Principle, AoC. Remember the lattice theory notes of mine.
- Fitting subgroup

### Rings

- Rings of continuous functions
- Matrix rings
- Polynomial rings (and in several variables)
- ~~Power series rings (and in several variables)~~
- ~~Laurent rings~~
- Boolean rings
- Direct products on rings
- Opposite rings
- **Much more exercises are required for rings compared to groups.**
- Jacobson radical

---

- Ring ideals (maximal, minimal, prime)
- Generators for subrings and ideals

## Finally

- Draw (more) diagrams.
- Proofread all.
- Re-order all.
- (Re-)enumerate Thms, Defs, Exercises etc.
