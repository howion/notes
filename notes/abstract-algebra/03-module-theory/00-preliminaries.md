Notations used in my Ring Theory notes is assumed.

<!-- * $\text{Im }f$ denotes the **image** of a function $f: A \to B$, so does the $f(A)$. -->
<!-- * For a function $f: A \to B$, the **fiber of $f$ over $b \in B$** is defined as the **preimage** of $\{b\}$. That is, the elements of $A$ that maps to $b$. -->
