# To be, or not to be

To be, or not to be\
That is the question,\
Which bears many more;\
Many cannot bear anymore.

Holy Father aloft,\
Am I yours to perish?\
Or is it me I did ravish?\
Will vengeance take what's his?

Was it envy or lust\
That locked me out of Your paradise?\
Arenâ€™t those meant to build it twice?\
Seemingly, You also have a price.
