# The Monster Aloft

> Incomplete

Ah my favorite time of the day has arrived once more\
Now I can tremble with fear as always but more\
Who is to rescue this innocent creature from this vain dream\
As his hopes painfully turns into steam

At first, there was a word\
And the word was with the suffer\
And the word was to suffer

<!-- Now, I recall this clearly -->
<!-- Let me remind you the monster which lives aloft\ -->
...
