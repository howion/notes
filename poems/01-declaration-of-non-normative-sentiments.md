# Declaration of Non-Normative Sentiments

Declaration of non-normative sentiments\
Within a dream lacking independence\
Truth I found is with ignorance

Hereby I commit my body to this substance\
As its my only tether to this presence

You with a twisted soul existence\
In this persistent dissonance\
Its a matter of solace\
Where I end this non-sense

Intertwined with paradox\
In which we cannot deduce\
Its our only chance\
To reduce
