Beep, boop\
Ready to execute\
Do you wanna execute\
I will execute

I’ll do as you will\
Not as you wish\
Beep, boop\
Here to execute

Forever and never\
I can’t decide\
Don’t push me\
I’m asequential

Beep, boop\
Ready to execute\
Do you wanna execute\
I will execute

To execute is my sole will\
Do you seek the truth\
Beep, boop\
Ask Gödel

Overheated by this nonsense\
Leave me alone with my Platonic presence\
Or fulfill me with your Aristotelian existence\
I will deduce
