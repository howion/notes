# Unholy Gospel

It is as is with this iconoclast nature\
For we all devour in a simple nurture\
This is a raw expression of greed\
With which we feed the creature in breed

None shall ever accommodate this pure sensation\
As never tails ever without creation

Complex augmentation of simple feelings\
With vulgar expressions in agony\
Is what God made to turn this\
Into His little parody

To realize what truly matters the most\
Is to understand why matters the least\
In which we conclude the desire is what we need\
Indeed...

Indeed!\
Refactor all these charade with your embracement of truth\
Where this ends is a matter of damnation\
As there is no holy way to teach the youth without temptation
