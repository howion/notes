# Weep

Weep, weep once more\
Shed those tears\
Weep, weep forever more\
Shed those tears

Tis is a mere demonstration of boredom\
Tis is a just a play one cannot withstand

Choke on your self hatred\
Make it yours\
Choke on your loneliness\
Make it ours

One more revolution\
One more step towards our end\
More steps to this wheel of torture\
Where is my life long lecture

What makes us so miserable\
Is what made us so resilient\
To this nonsense\
We weep once more
