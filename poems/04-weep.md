# Weep

Weep, weep once more\
Shed those tears\
Weep, weep forever more\
Shed those tears

This is a mere demonstration of boredom\
This is a just a play one cannot withstand

Choke on your self-hatred\
Make it yours\
Choke on your loneliness\
Make it ours

One more revolution\
One more step towards our end\
More steps to this wheel of torture\
Where is my life long lecture?

What makes us so miserable\
Is what made us so resilient!\
To this nonsense,\
We weep once more...
